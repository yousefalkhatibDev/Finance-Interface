**What is ERP Finance?**

Generally, an ERP financial module is a software program that gathers financial data and then generates reports. It allows you to communicate financial information more clearly to external partners such as vendors and your customers when needed. You can accomplish this through functions such as accounts payable, accounts receivable, general ledger, budgeting, and more.

**What is Accounting Software?**

It’s easy to confuse accounting and ERP financial software, but they have distinct characteristics. In essence, finance ERP focuses on the future with tools that emphasize budgeting, forecasting, and planning. Oppositely, accounting zeros in on current and historical data like general ledger balancing, reporting, expense management, tax management, etc. You may also find these features in finance modules to streamline the bookkeeping process.

Read on to learn about some of the most basic and popular aspects of ERP financial management software that you might consider in your ERP solution.

**Software Requirements**

**Profit Tracking**

A primary function of ERP financial management modules is profit tracking. The profit tracker will help provide a bird’s-eye view of the business’s overall financial health and financial resource leveraging. Tracking your profits will show you where more profits are coming from and determine the return on investment for any buy.

The tracker uses the incurred costs and receivables to calculate how much your organization profits from your efforts. Some programs will forecast future profits based on historical expenses and sales data.

**Ledger Management**

Ledger management is another fundamental function of ERP financial systems. A general ledger provides a thorough record of all financial transactions. It integrates with all of your other ERP modules, such as inventory management or customer relationship management.

Entries are typically made directly into the general ledger (GL), but your system may allow you to make entries anywhere within the application. Either way, you’ll be able to view your entries in one central location. You can keep track of a variety of things; for example, assets, liabilities, capital accounts, income, and expenses.

**Accounts Payable**

Accounts payable will manage all of the funds your company owes to your vendors and other creditors. An accounts payable feature integrates your expense data with your purchasing system so you can take control of your cash flows.

Automating accounts payable will save you money and time on labor hours as well as avoid human errors. The system can quickly process large amounts of invoices and other financial transactions between your company and vendors. Some applications offer document capture, also known as imaging features, which converts paper invoices into electronic documents.

**Accounts Receivable**

Accounts receivable allows your business to manage all of the funds customers owe them. It will track customer payments as well as manage invoices and cash.

Some ERP financial systems offer a portal for your customers where they can make payments or access invoices. You can automate tasks such as sending payment reminders or account statements and generating recurring invoices.

**Fixed Asset Management**

This solution tracks and manages all of your company’s tangible assets, such as manufacturing equipment, computers, company cars, and office space. It will take into account depreciation calculations, compliance requirements, and tax implications.

Asset management gives your organization better visibility in terms of utilization, costs, and maintenance. For example, keeping track of the depreciation of your assets can help you forecast expenditures and create budgets.

**Risk Management**

A great deal of business is ultimately about risk, and business leaders want to know that their organization is protected. Risk management tools can predict, analyze and manage crises.

These situations can range anywhere from financial issues to even natural disasters. Other potential calamities to manage with risk management solutions could be related to security, legal liabilities, compliance, or reputational risks.

**Reporting**

Analytics provide real-time access to financial data, which is crucial for maintaining your finances. The visibility helps you make data-driven predictions and decisions concerning your company’s finances.

On a basic level, reporting and analytics will show you where you’re generating revenue. But the dashboard can do so much more, such as display your sales, expected sales, expenses, and many other financial components. Typically, the dashboard is customizable, so you can choose which categories you would like to see. Review real-time data in graph formats so you may quickly understand your organization’s financial health.

**Multi-Currency Management**

If you have global clients, the ability to manage multiple currencies is critical. Multi-currency management automates the process of both buying and selling in foreign currencies. Currency conversion capabilities allow you to complete transactions in numerous currencies.

**Tax Management**

Tax management solutions store system taxation settings and provide tax audit and tax reporting functions. Leverage these settings across the system to provide a consistent collection of sales and VAT taxes.

Perhaps your tax management feature will complete the tedious task of determining sales tax jurisdictions of ship-to addresses or use prebuilt tax intelligence to process sales transactions in compliance with proper regulations. The capabilities of this accessory depend on which ERP financial system you purchase and the needs of your company. Either way, employing tax management within your organization is a great way to avoid spending time on mundane tasks.
